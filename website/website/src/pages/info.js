          a condition where the heartâ€™s arteries become narrow or clogged, reducing blood flow to the heart. 
          Heart diseases belong to the greater family of Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs): disorders which primarily affect the heart and its blood vessels. 
          CVDs take the lives of more than 17 million people around the world each year.</p>
