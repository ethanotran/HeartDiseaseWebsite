# HeartDiseaseWebsite
This project is intended to aid users in catching and treating heart disease early. Its features include an interactive home page, numerous informative pages on models used, 
general information and statistics, and about the team. The website's main feature is an interactive survey, where users will be asked to input medical data.
Upon completion, the website will output whether any risks of heart disease were detected, as well as which of the user's input was outside healthy ranges, including 
helpful links to other websites on the input in question. This website's front end was developed using the React framework, Javascript and CSS, while the backend was developed
using the Flask framework and Python. Two datasets and two corresponding pipelines, consisiting of various machine-learning models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Neighbors were implemented in 
Kaggle. These pipelines also also feature an ensemble learning method, specifically majority voting to determine the prediction.
